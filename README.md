Assignment Descriptions

Assignment 1: 
A bash script that plots Collatz sequences using collatz.c and Makefile to pdf files.

Assigment 2: 
Containts functions that mimics some of the functions in the math library, math.h.
The file functions.c uses mathlib.c's functions and formats them into specific functions for 
integrate.c to integrate using the composite Simpson's 1/3 rule.

Assignment 3:
Sorts pseudo-random array using different sorting algorithms based on command line input.
You can specify the random seed and the sorting alorithms you want to use. The sorting algorithms include
Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Batcher Sort, and Quick Sort.

Assignment 4:
Simulates John Conway's the Game of Life. Command line options allows the user to feed
the program an input file and using the in the file data create a universe based on its specifications. The number of
generations that the game will last and whether the universe will be toroidal can also be specified. Once the game is
over then the program will print the final resulting universe of the game to a specified output file.

Assignment 5:
Implements RSA encrytpion which generate public and private keys for a given file and is able to encrypt and decrypt them.

Assignment 6:
Takes input file and compresses the contents using Huffaman encoding and writing a compressed version to an outfile.
This is done through the encoder, and the decoder takes an encoded file and decodes the contents to another specified
output file.

Assignment 7:
The program takes an anonymous text and using a data base of authors with matched texts, analyze the linguistic styles and 
patterns of the texts and to try and match the anonymous text with the most likely authors.
